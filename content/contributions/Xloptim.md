## Technical Overview

XLOptim was a specialized optimization add-on for Excel, developed by XLSTAT (later acquired by Lumivero) as a proof of concept that leveraged LocalSolver(Hexaly)'s powerful local search optimization engine.

## Core Technology: C++ to VBA Wrapper

### Technical Architecture

#### Wrapper Technology
- **Language Bridge**: Custom C++ to VBA wrapper
- **Purpose**: Enable seamless integration of LocalSolver's C++ optimization engine with Excel's VBA environment
- **Key Components**:
    - C++ Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
    - VBA Interface Module
    - Memory Management Layer
    - Optimization Algorithm Translations

#### Wrapper Functionality
- **Data Translation**: Convert Excel cell ranges to C++ data structures
- **Optimization Engine Calls**: Translate VBA parameters to mathematical model
- **Result Propagation**: Return optimization results back to Excel spreadsheets
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management between C++ and VBA contexts



## Optimization Approach

### LocalSolver Integration
- **Search Strategy**: Local search metaheuristics
- **Optimization Types**:
    - Continuous optimization
    - Discrete optimization
    - Mixed-integer optimization

### Excel Add-On Capabilities
